Hi! I'm Chie, the guild receptionist's little sister and assistant.
What do I do? Well, I'm here to give adventurers an assistance with their tasks.

Sometimes, whenever I have a free time, I often go on an adventure myself.
What? You like to hear the tale of Chie the wayfarer? Hehe~ I don't have much
to tell right now, but I'll let you know if I go on an adventure.
