## Contributing Guidelines

#### A brief description about this project
* Chie is a Discord Bot similar to [Rena](https://github.com/Nhalrath/Rena), they are both made for the sake of learning and everyone is welcome to contribute.

#### How to contribute to Rena
* You can contribute in any way you like, be it making a new feature, improvements, etc.
* Keep in mind that the author of this project is also novice. He would appreciate it if you don't make changes too complicated.
* When making a commit, be sure to follow the message pattern:

  **<1> (<2>) [3]**
  
  <> - are required\
  [] - are oprional\
  1 - may include actions such as 'Add', 'Fix', or 'Refactor'\
  2 - filename or a sigle word summary(only if you worked with multiple files.)
  3 - is a summary of your changes

#### Additional notes
* This is a small project, so there's no need to make a strict guideline. At least for now.
