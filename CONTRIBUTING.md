## Contributing Guidelines

#### A brief description about this project
* Chie is a simple static bot for Discord. It does very basic stuffs like most other bots do.
  Despite having this limitation, it will soon be relying on lots of APIs to operate in order to make up for not having a database-related modules.

#### How to contribute to Chie
* You can contribute in any way you like, be it by making a new feature, improvements, etc.
* A simple, but reasonable commit message will do(refer to the convention below).

#### Conventions
You are not required to follow these instructions, but it would be better if you could, so that we can avoid potential complications.
* Commit messages for editing an existing file must be all lowercased. (ex.`refactor`, `bug fixes for imageboard command`.)
* Commit messages for a new feature or new modules must start with an uppercase character. (ex. `Add game API`, `Add game module`.)
* Do not include different changes in a single commit.
* Add `#TODO do domething` comments in files that requires other's attention.
