# More Info:


## Regarding to another version of this Bot
As you can see, crimsonite-01(Chie) has very a few commands, and that is because it is made for learning purposes.
Right now, the owner is currently working on another similar project, but a much simpler one, so this project might not get
enough attention to maintain.

## Are you planning to use this software in your own project?
This is an open-source project and you can use it as long as you follow the [license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

I suggest that you edit most of the functions to make it more readable. (The owner too lazy to clean this up, and the whole code itself is a mess つ﹏⊂.)
