## Starting up the bot
  It is very easy to get the bot online, all you need to do is edit the config.yml file.
```yaml
# Set this to "true" if you prefer using environmental variables
use_system_environment: false

# Only set this to "true" if your guild count is high enough
use_sharding: false
shard_count: 0

# Token is required to login to your bot
TOKEN: "Your Token here"

# This is self-explanatory
PREFIX: "Your Prefix here"
```
