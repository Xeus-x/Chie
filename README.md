## Are you planning to use this software in your own project?
This is an open-source project and you can use it as long as you follow the [license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

I suggest that you edit most of the functions to make it more readable. (The owner too lazy to clean this up, and the whole code itself is a mess つ﹏⊂.)
